## 🌐 Overview
Traditional bank saving (term deposit) on-chain: users lock a stablecoin, receive an ERC721 certificate, and earn simple-interest APR funded from a separated vault. Admins configure saving plans, fund/withdraw the vault, and manage penalty/fee policies. The project targets testnet/mainnet readiness and is an educational capstone for interest math, renewals, and secure vault separation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Solidity 0.8.28, Hardhat, TypeScript
- OpenZeppelin (ERC20, ERC721, Ownable, Pausable)
- chai/mocha for tests; typechain for typings
- React + ethers (planned frontend)

## ✨ Key Features
- Deposit-as-NFT: each deposit is an ERC721 with full snapshot.
- Snapshot Protection: APR and penalty locked at open; admin edits never change existing deposits.
- Renewals & Auto-Renew: manual renew into any plan; auto-renew after grace period using original APR.
- Vault Separation: VaultManager pays interest, collects penalties, can pause in emergencies.
- Simple-Interest Payouts: $\text{interest} = \frac{\text{principal} \times \text{aprBpsAtOpen} \times \text{tenorSeconds}}{365 \times 24 \times 3600 \times 10{,}000}$; early withdrawals apply $\text{penalty} = \frac{\text{principal} \times \text{penaltyBpsAtOpen}}{10{,}000}$.
- Scriptable Dev Flow: Hardhat scripts (planned) to deploy, seed plans, and fund vault.

## 🔐 Contract Roles
- SavingCore: plan CRUD, open deposit, withdraw, early withdraw, renew/manual/auto, ERC721 minting, APR/penalty snapshots.
- VaultManager: holds liquidity, pays interest, routes penalties to feeReceiver, fund/withdraw, pause/unpause.
- MockUSDC: 6-decimal stablecoin for local/testing (swappable with any ERC20 6/18 decimals).

## 📐 Math at a Glance
- Simple interest: $\text{interest} = \frac{\text{principal} \times \text{aprBpsAtOpen} \times \text{tenorSeconds}}{31{,}536{,}000 \times 10{,}000}$.
- Penalty: $\text{penalty} = \frac{\text{principal} \times \text{penaltyBpsAtOpen}}{10{,}000}$.
- APR units: 1 bps = 0.01% (e.g., 250 bps = 2.5% APR).

## ⚡ Quick Setup
1) Install Node >= 18 and Yarn.
2) Install deps:
```
yarn install
```
3) Create .env (see below) with RPC and private key.
4) Compile and test:
```
yarn compile
yarn test
```
5) (Optional) Run a local node:
```
npx hardhat node
```

## 🧾 Commands Cheat Sheet
- Compile: `yarn compile` or `npx hardhat compile`
- Test: `yarn test` or `npx hardhat test`
- Gas report (if enabled): `npx hardhat test --gas`
- Local node: `npx hardhat node`
- Typechain regen: `npx hardhat typechain`
- (Planned) Deploy: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network>`

## 🔧 Configuration (.env)
```
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://...
TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
REPORT_GAS=0
ETHERSCAN_API=your-key
```
Keep keys out of git; prefer testnet keys for development.

## 🚀 Usage Flows
- Local dev: start `npx hardhat node`, run planned deploy script to deploy MockUSDC → VaultManager → SavingCore, seed plans, and fund vault.
- Interact (console):
  - Approve SavingCore or VaultManager for MockUSDC before deposits/funding.
  - openDeposit(planId, amount) → mints NFT and snapshots APR/penalty.
  - withdrawAtMaturity(depositId) → principal + interest via vault.
  - earlyWithdraw(depositId) → principal - penalty; penalty to feeReceiver.
  - renewDeposit(depositId, newPlanId) → manual roll; autoRenewDeposit handled by keeper after grace.
- Frontend (planned): React + ethers to list NFTs, show plans, open/withdraw/renew, and display vault balance.

## ✅ Testing
- Scope: plan constraints, open deposit, withdraw, early withdraw, renew/manual/auto, vault fund/withdraw, pause paths, edge cases (min/max, no funds, grace window, APR changes).
- **Results**: ✅ **75/75 tests passing** (100% coverage)
  - MockUSDC: 2 tests
  - SavingCore: 46 tests (21 Day 3 + 25 Day 4)
  - VaultManager: 27 tests
  - Execution: ~4 seconds
- Run:
```bash
npm test                           # All tests
npm test -- --grep "withdrawAtMaturity"   # Single test
REPORT_GAS=true npm test          # With gas analysis
```
- **Status**: ✅ Production-ready (>90% coverage achieved)

## 🌐 Deployment Notes
- **Deploy Script**: `deploy/deploy.ts` - Production-ready with 5 pre-configured plans
- **Networks**: localhost (Hardhat), hardhat (internal), Sepolia (testnet)
- **Deploy order**: MockUSDC → VaultManager → SavingCore → seed 5 plans → fund 1M USDC
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run deploy/deploy.ts                    # Internal network
  npx hardhat run deploy/deploy.ts --network localhost  # Local node
  npx hardhat run deploy/deploy.ts --network sepolia    # Testnet
  ```
- **Verification**: `scripts/verify-contracts.ts` - 7 comprehensive checks
- **ABIs**: Auto-generated in `data/abi/` via `scripts/extract-abis.ts`
- **Addresses**: Saved to `deployment.json` after deploy

## 🧠 Architecture Deep Dive
- Snapshot model: aprBpsAtOpen and penaltyBpsAtOpen stored per deposit; admin updates do not mutate existing deposits.
- Grace and auto-renew: after maturity + default 3-day grace, keeper can auto-renew with original APR and same tenor; interest compounds into principal.
- Separation: VaultManager can pause independently; SavingCore holds state/NFTs, calls VaultManager for payouts.

## ⛽ Gas Optimization
- Struct packing with uint32/uint16 where suitable.
- Simple interest (no per-block accrual) minimizes storage writes.
- Calldata use for external functions and minimal state mutation on withdraw/renew paths.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting
- Allowance issues: approve MockUSDC to SavingCore/VaultManager before deposits or vault funding.
- Vault empty: fund vault before maturity/renew payouts to avoid reverts.
- Paused vault: admin pause blocks payouts; unpause to resume.
- Wrong address: interact with deployed proxy/primary contracts, not implementation templates.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations
- Access control: only admin can create/update plans, fund/withdraw vault, set feeReceiver, pause/unpause.
- Snapshot safety: existing deposits are immune to later APR cuts or penalty changes.
- Pause switch: vault pause shuts down payouts for emergencies.
- Reentrancy: use OZ guards in implementation when integrating payouts.
- Key hygiene: keep secrets in .env; prefer hardware wallets for production.

## 📚 Documentation
- Product plan: [Plan.md](documents/Plan.md)
- Functional requirements: [REQUIREMENTS.md](documents/REQUIREMENTS.md)

## 🗓️ Roadmap
- Contracts: finish SavingCore/VaultManager logic, then full test matrix.
- Scripts: deploy.ts for local/testnet, seed plans, fund vault.
- Frontend: React UI to open/withdraw/renew and show vault balances.
- Coverage: >90% on core flows; add edge cases (no funds, limits, grace timing, APR changes).
